## Hello folks, this is Vipul  <img src="https://docs.mixster.dev/img/hatching.gif" height=25 width=25 />

I am a product owner & software engineer with 6+ years of experience building hard-tech applications, scalable pipelines, resilient systems in resource-constrained environments, dynamic documentation, and open-source communities.

At [balena](https://balena.io), I am building an open-source hardware testing jig & automation framework to test operating systems directly on edge devices drastically improving reliability and fast-tracking release cycles of balenaOS from 6 weeks to 3 hours. 

Leviathan is an e2e testing framework to test operating systems on multiple workers & Autokit is a plug-and-play automation jig used by our customers & partners to support BalenaOS on their own hardware. I wear multiple hats at work. 

Apart from my full-time commitment, I run [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster) to enable startups and organizations to "right" their docs, build their engineering culture and create scalable content pipelines from scratch. Our USP: `We are engineers who love writing docs`.

I am a documentarian in life too and have been [documenting my life](http://mixster.dev/), [work](https://docs.mixster.dev/), and [travel](https://docs.mixster.dev/Communities) extensively. I believe strongly in ownership, eliminating problems, radical candor (friends don't let friends be wrong), transparency, collaboration, and trying cheesecakes in every place I visit.
