### Hello folks, this is Vipul :hatching_chick:

At [balena](https://balena.io), I am building an open-source hardware testing jig & automation framework to test (embedded) operating systems directly on an IoT device. Leviathan is an e2e testing framework to test operating systems on multiple workers & Autokit is a plug-and-play automation jig used by our customers & partners to support BalenaOS on their hardware. Apart from wearing multiple hats at work, I help open-source organizations "right" their docs with [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster).

I also have been [documenting my life](http://mixster.dev/), [try to speak more about my work](https://docs.mixster.dev/Talks), and [organize even more conferences & meetups](https://docs.mixster.dev/Communities). I believe in ethical open-source contributions, radical candor (friends don't let friends be wrong), and trying cheesecakes in each country I visit.
