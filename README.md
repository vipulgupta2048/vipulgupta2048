## Hello folks, this is Vipul  <img src="https://docs.mixster.dev/img/hatching.gif" height=25 width=25 />

I am a product owner & software engineer with 5+ years of experience building hard-tech IoT applications, documentation, and communities in the open.

At [balena](https://balena.io), I am building an open-source hardware testing jig & automation framework to test (embedded) operating systems directly on an IoT device. Leviathan is an e2e testing framework to test operating systems on multiple workers & Autokit is a plug-and-play automation jig used by our customers & partners to support BalenaOS on their hardware. I wear multiple hats at work. Apart from my full time commitment, I run [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster) to enable startups and organizations to "right" their docs, build their engineering culture and create content pipelines from scratch.

I am a documentarian in life and have been [documenting my life](http://mixster.dev/), [try to speak more about my work](https://docs.mixster.dev/Talks), and [organize even more conferences & meetups](https://docs.mixster.dev/Communities). I believe in ethical open-source contributions, radical candor (friends don't let friends be wrong), and trying cheesecakes in every place I visit.
